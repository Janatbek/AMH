                    <h2>What is "Junk"</h2>

                    <p class="lead">Are you thinking about using a junk removal service but are wondering what is actually meant by “junk”? This term is often used for anything in your home or business that you no longer want. This may be because it’s broken and no longer works or you simply don’t use it anymore. Often, people call old and useless items or equipment “junk”, as it has little value to them and it’s cluttering up their home. Of course, junk can be anything from large appliances to small items. There will always be someone to take it off your hands. Whether your items can be recycled or given as a charitable donation, not all junk is really “junk”!</p>

                    <h3>Lessen Your Workload</h3>

                    <p class="lead">We make your move faster by hauling away your office junk, including office furniture, old office equipment, specialty equipment, cubicles, office trash, electronics like computers, fax machines and phones, and much more. There’s no limit to what or how much junk we can haul!</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Plus, we recycle or reuse up to 80% of everything we pick up and haul. If your goods are still usable, we may donate them to a local charity. As e-waste collectors, we’ll make sure all your electronics are handled, recycled and disposed of properly. And if our actions don’t speak for themselves, our uniforms and trucks do! Our uniforms are made from recycled polyester, our business cards are printed on recycled paper and our trucks are hybrids with 30% more space than other junk haulers. All these things mean we minimize our impact on the environment as we strive to do the same for you during your office cleanout.

                    <p class="lead">In addition to simply hauling away your office junk, we can provide labor services or a rental dumpster. With our labor services, don’t worry about placing furniture, unpacking boxes or cleaning out your old spaces. Our crew will arrive ready to work. And with our dumpster option, you can move out and cleanup on your own schedule. We’ll drop the dumpster off where and when you’d like, then just tell us when to pick up.</p>

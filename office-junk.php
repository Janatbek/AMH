				<h3>Lessen Your Workload</h3>

				<p class="lead">We make your move faster by hauling away your office junk, including office furniture, old office equipment, specialty equipment, cubicles, office trash, electronics like computers, fax machines and phones, and much more. There’s no limit to what or how much junk we can haul!</p>
				<p class="lead">
					Plus, we recycle or reuse up to 80% of everything we pick up and haul. If your goods are still usable, we may donate them to a local charity. As e-waste collectors, we’ll make sure all your electronics are handled, recycled and disposed of properly. And if our actions don’t speak for themselves, our uniforms and trucks do! Our uniforms are made from recycled polyester, our business cards are printed on recycled paper and our trucks are hybrids with 30% more space than other junk haulers. All these things mean we minimize our impact on the environment as we strive to do the same for you during your office cleanout.

					<p class="lead">If you’ve ever tried to move a fridge or stove, you know it’s a difficult job without help. Aside from the heavy lifting dangers associated with trying to haul a heavy appliance to the dump, improper disposal can also harm the environment. Many old house hold contain ozone-depleting chemicals that disperse into the air when left to break down in a landfill. Taking the proper steps to handle your appliance removal responsibly not only preserves your back health, but the health of the environment, too.</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We kindly ask that you unhook any appliances before we arrive, as we are not electricians by trade. You won't have to do any of the heavy liftings, though! We make it easy to recycle and dispose of appliances in a way that's environmentally friendly. Just contact us to schedule a pickup that fits your needs.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						As a bonus, replacing older ones with newer models will save energy consumption and usually lowers your bill, all the while reducing the use of fossil fuels. Let us help you remove the old to make room for something new!

						If you have an old fridge that still works, it’s best to see if it can be donated. Many local charities accept donations of larger appliances as long as they’re still in working order.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						If your fridge is broken, it will need to be recycled. Research your local area to find out where you’ll need to drop off your fridge for proper recycling. If you can’t drop it off on your own, or simply just don’t have the time, let us handle it for you. We make it easy to get rid of your old fridge—we’ll do all the heavy lifting for you, and we’ll make sure it gets to the right place for proper disposal.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Any product containing metal should be recycled. Production of new metals can be costly and damaging to the environment. When we recycle metals, it helps to reduce the environmental impact of using metals. Many smaller appliances also contain substances that can decompose when left to sit in a landfill, releasing gases into the air and other toxins that can contaminate the soil and water supply.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We’re happy to help you get rid of any unwanted appliances. We’ll pick up the items for you and ensure they get recycled and properly disposed of.

						Getting rid of old furniture certainly isn’t an easy process. It's heavy, it's awkward, it's hard to maneuver, and it’s nearly impossible to do on your own. Even if you can manage to convince someone to help you with the heavy lifting, you still have to drop it off for donation or at the dump on your own.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Luckily, there's a much easier way to deal with furniture removal — let us take care of it for you! It might just be the easiest decision you’ll ever make.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We are ready, willing & able to help you deal with a wide array of furniture pieces:
						<ul>
							<li>Couches, sofa beds, ottomans & futons</li>
							<li>Coffee, dining & side tables</li>
							<li>Filing cabinets, china cabinets & credenzas</li>

						Are you remodeling and putting in new flooring? Whether you’re replacing your old worn out carpet with new carpeting or putting in hardwood flooring or tile instead, you may be wondering what to do with your old carpet remnants. What if you could just point, and make it all disappear?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Even though your carpet has reached the end of its life in your home, that doesn't mean it can't be repurposed to create new products. Old carpeting can be recycled and used to create new carpet, as well as plastic parts for auto interiors and engines, industrial flooring, and even parking barriers.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						At American Junk Haul, we can take all types of household and commercial carpeting as well as large area rugs. After we remove your carpet, we evaluate the condition and decide whether it should be disposed or recycled. Rest assured, we always choose the most environmentally-friendly method available.

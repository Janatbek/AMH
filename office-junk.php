				<h3>Lessen Your Workload</h3>

				<p class="lead">We make your move faster by hauling away your office junk, including office furniture, old office equipment, specialty equipment, cubicles, office trash, electronics like computers, fax machines and phones, and much more. There’s no limit to what or how much junk we can haul!</p>
				<p class="lead">
					Plus, we recycle or reuse up to 80% of everything we pick up and haul. If your goods are still usable, we may donate them to a local charity. As e-waste collectors, we’ll make sure all your electronics are handled, recycled and disposed of properly. And if our actions don’t speak for themselves, our uniforms and trucks do! Our uniforms are made from recycled polyester, our business cards are printed on recycled paper and our trucks are hybrids with 30% more space than other junk haulers. All these things mean we minimize our impact on the environment as we strive to do the same for you during your office cleanout.

					<!-- Computers -->
					<h5>Computers</h5>

					<p class="lead">Technology is advancing at a rapid pace these days, which means that people are replacing their laptops, computers, and tablets much more often.

					<h5>Printers</h5>

					<p class="lead">
						These days, printers can do everything – from printing, scanning, and copying – and they’re even getting more affordable. (It’s often cheaper to buy a whole new printer than it is to replace the ink!) In many cases, people end up upgrading them much more often than they used to. Got a printer that you want to upgrade, or one that’s broken and you don’t know where to put it?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						If you need to recycle printers that no longer meet your needs, we can help. We’ll either get your printers recycled or, if they’re still in working order, get them to someone who can use them.

					<p class="lead">
						Getting rid of old workspace furniture certainly isn’t an easy process. It's heavy, it's awkward, it's hard to maneuver, and it’s nearly impossible to do on your own. Even if you can manage to convince someone to help you with the heavy lifting, you still have to drop it off for donation or at the dump on your own.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Luckily, there's a much easier way to deal with furniture removal — let us take care of it for you! It might just be the easiest decision you’ll ever make.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We are ready, willing & able to help you deal with a wide array of furniture pieces:
						<ul>
							<li>Couches, sofa beds, ottomans & futons</li>
							<li>Coffee, dining & side tables</li>
							<li>Filing cabinets, china cabinets & credenzas</li>

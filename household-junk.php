					<h2>SERVICES OFFERED:</h2>
					<h5>Appliances</h5>

					<p class="lead">If you’ve ever tried to move a fridge or stove, you know it’s a difficult job without help. Aside from the heavy lifting dangers associated with trying to haul a heavy appliance to the dump, improper disposal can also harm the environment. Many old house hold contain ozone-depleting chemicals that disperse into the air when left to break down in a landfill. Taking the proper steps to handle your appliance removal responsibly not only preserves your back health, but the health of the environment, too.</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We kindly ask that you unhook any appliances before we arrive, as we are not electricians by trade. You won't have to do any of the heavy liftings, though! We make it easy to recycle and dispose of appliances in a way that's environmentally friendly. Just contact us to schedule a pickup that fits your needs.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						As a bonus, replacing older ones with newer models will save energy consumption and usually lowers your bill, all the while reducing the use of fossil fuels. Let us help you remove the old to make room for something new!

					<h5>Refrigerators</h5>

					<p class="lead">
						If you have an old fridge that still works, it’s best to see if it can be donated. Many local charities accept donations of larger appliances as long as they’re still in working order.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						If your fridge is broken, it will need to be recycled. Research your local area to find out where you’ll need to drop off your fridge for proper recycling. If you can’t drop it off on your own, or simply just don’t have the time, let us handle it for you. We make it easy to get rid of your old fridge—we’ll do all the heavy lifting for you, and we’ll make sure it gets to the right place for proper disposal.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Any product containing metal should be recycled. Production of new metals can be costly and damaging to the environment. When we recycle metals, it helps to reduce the environmental impact of using metals. Many smaller appliances also contain substances that can decompose when left to sit in a landfill, releasing gases into the air and other toxins that can contaminate the soil and water supply.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We’re happy to help you get rid of any unwanted appliances. We’ll pick up the items for you and ensure they get recycled and properly disposed of.

						Getting rid of old furniture certainly isn’t an easy process. It's heavy, it's awkward, it's hard to maneuver, and it’s nearly impossible to do on your own. Even if you can manage to convince someone to help you with the heavy lifting, you still have to drop it off for donation or at the dump on your own.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Luckily, there's a much easier way to deal with furniture removal — let us take care of it for you! It might just be the easiest decision you’ll ever make.

						We are ready, willing & able to help you deal with a wide array of furniture pieces:

							<li>Filing cabinets, china cabinets & credenzas</li>

					<h5>Mattresses</h5>

					<p class="lead">
						If you need to get rid of an old mattress, you know they can be difficult to dispose of. Not only are they large and difficult to move on your own, but they also can’t simply be thrown in the garbage. If you handle it on your own, most of the options for mattress disposal will surely require a lot of time and effort on your part. The good news is, there’s an easy way to get rid of your old mattress. (And it doesn’t involve abandoning it in an alleyway!)
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Instead of dealing with that cumbersome mattress yourself, call American Junk Haul and let our efficient team of professionals pick up your old bed and ensure it's disposed of properly. We can usually arrange for same day service which is convenient when you have new furniture that's being delivered or you've simply run out of space.

					<h5>Carpeting</h5>

					<p class="lead">
						Are you remodeling and putting in new flooring? Whether you’re replacing your old worn out carpet with new carpeting or putting in hardwood flooring or tile instead, you may be wondering what to do with your old carpet remnants. What if you could just point, and make it all disappear?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Even though your carpet has reached the end of its life in your home, that doesn't mean it can't be repurposed to create new products. Old carpeting can be recycled and used to create new carpet, as well as plastic parts for auto interiors and engines, industrial flooring, and even parking barriers.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						At American Junk Haul, we can take all types of household and commercial carpeting as well as large area rugs. After we remove your carpet, we evaluate the condition and decide whether it should be disposed or recycled. Rest assured, we always choose the most environmentally-friendly method available.

					<h5>Electronics</h5>

					<p class="lead">
						Technology is rapidly changing, which means we all inevitably end up with broken electronics (e waste) that we need to get rid of. But it’s not as simple as throwing it in the garbage. These items often contain hazardous materials and should be recycled or disposed of properly to avoid doing damage to the environment.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						That’s where American Junk Haul comes in. We’re experienced in providing electronics removal and are happy to help get those old items out of your way. Our friendly team of professionals will ensure that your e waste gets donated to organizations and charities in need, or sent to be refurbished and recycled as much as possible, leaving only a minimal amount to be safely disposed.

					<p class="lead">
						Some e-waste that we commonly accept includes:
						<ul>
							<li>VCRs</li>

							<li>Handheld Devices</li>

					<p class="lead">
						If you have an old hot tub to get rid of, it’s not the something you can easily handle on your own. Even if you can find some friends who are willing to help you out, it’s still quite a tricky task. Save yourself some time and a whole lot of effort. Let  American Junk Haul take care of it for you!
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						To get your hot tub ready for removal, there are a few things you’ll need to do before we get there. First, you’ll need to disconnect the power supply. Then you’ll need to drain out all the water and allow the tub to completely dry. Lastly, you’ll need to ensure there’s a clear path to the hot tub for easy removal. That means clearing away any leaves, or debris that might get in the way as we’re moving it out.

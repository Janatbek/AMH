<h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
<p class="lead"><strong>a. Binding Arbitration</strong><br>
Except for any exclusions and restrictions set forth below, you and AmericanJunkHaul.com agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies between you and AmericanJunkHaul.com arising out of or relating to this User Agreement (including the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof) or any use of the Resources (“Claims”) shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) by a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA in accordance with the Rules, or, if the AAA is not available, by such other arbitration association as mutually agreed by the parties. Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, in the English language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered by any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement. The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages. For purposes of this Agreement, “Claims” includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this dispute resolution section (with the exception of the enforceability of the class action waiver provision set forth below) and “AmericanJunkHaul.com” means AmericanJunkHaul.com and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective owners, officers, directors, employees and agents. This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $75,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the arbitration organization.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>b. Class Action Waiver</strong><br>
You and AmericanJunkHaul.com agree that all Claims will be arbitrated on an individual basis and that there will be no class, consolidated or representative actions in arbitration. There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users or other persons similarly situated. You and AmericanJunkHaul.com may not participate in a class or representative action against the other party as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were asserted directly. You and AmericanJunkHaul.com agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of the arbitration agreement and that the class action waiver may not be severed from the arbitration agreement. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator, then the entire arbitration agreement set forth herein will not apply to any Claim between the parties. If the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator, then you and AmericanJunkHaul.com agree that any proceedings in court will be conducted on an individual basis and that there will be no class or representative actions.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>c. Excluded Claims</strong><br>
You and AmericanJunkHaul.com agree that the following will not be subject to arbitration (“Excluded Claims”): (1) any Claim relating to the validity or infringement of any party’s intellectual property right (such as trademarks, trade dress, copyright and patents), (2) any Claim relating to or arising from allegations associated with unauthorized use of or access to the Resources in violation of of this User Agreement; (3) any Claim where you or AmericanJunkHaul.com are seeking a preliminary injunction; and (4) any Claim proceeding on an individual (non-class, non-consolidated, non-representative) basis filed in a court that is limited to adjudicating small claims. For the purposes of these Excluded Claims, any action shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in the state of California and the county of Los Angeles. You hereby acknowledge your agreement to the personal jurisdiction of such courts, and that you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>d. Fees</strong><br>
In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim (except for any Excluded Claim) other than an arbitration, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim other than in the forum specified, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this agreement to arbitrate and proceed in the forum to which the parties have herein agreed.</p>
